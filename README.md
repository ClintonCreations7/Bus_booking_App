For this project I made use of Python and Pyweb-IO for the creation of a bus booking application that simulates a real
one.
Before actually accessing the main page of the application the user will have to enter username and password, the user
can decide to change the password through the forgot password button.
Once the user access the home page they will be able to place a booking by filling a classic form where they input the
trip info.
After that the user will see a summary of the info that they entered and decide to either accept or not, if they do so
a booking ID will be created and will be placed in the MY bookings section where they can decide to cancel the booking.
Validations are in place to make sure that it simulates a real booking application, like for example the number of seats
for each bus is 10 and if the user enters a number higher than the available seats they will see a error message.
Also the price of the whole booking that takes the set price of the route and times it by the number of passengers and
the type of route that they chose (Round-Trip or Single)...
